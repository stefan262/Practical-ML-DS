# PyTorch datasets and dataloaders

## Go to PyTorch docs and find what datasets PyTorch provides
- look at docs for how to get the dataset
- show code implementing getting dataset

## Challenge: RESEARCH how to split datasets into train and test in PyTorch

## Challenge: IMPLEMENT code to get a dataset and visualise an example and prepare it to go into a PyTorch model
- students will need to apply transformations in their dataloaders
