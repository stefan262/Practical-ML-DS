# Neural networks

## Recap PyTorch
- ASK: what's the key feature of PyTorch?

## Go through notebook as it is laid out (lots of theory to get through here)

## Walk through PyTorch implementation of neural network

## CHALLENGE: Get students to replicate the same neural network implementation

## CHALLENGE: Implement your own neural network
