    "In short, __calculus__ is the study of change. More specifically, in the field of calculus, we concern ourselves with the question: \"How does a quantity Y change with respect to some quantity X?\". Before diving into calculus, we will go over __linear equations/functions__ , which are functions that describe straight lines. These functions are given in the general form of:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(x) = y = mx + c$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where, y is the __output__, x is the __input__, c is the __y-intercept__ and m is __slope or gradient__.\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(x)$ denotes a __function__ of x, which just means a quantity that is affected by the input, x. With different combinations of the parameters m and c we can describe any straight line on the 2-D plane. However, our main reason for covering this equation is the slope, m. Consider the 4 examples plotted below:\n",

    "$$(1) \\; y_{A} = 0.5x - 3$$\n",
    "$$(2) \\; y_{B} = x - 3$$\n",
    "$$(3) \\; y_{C} = 2x - 3$$\n",
    "$$(4) \\; y_{D} = 4x - 3$$"

    "From this graph, we can see that the parameter c just shifts lines up or down, so what is m responsible for? We can clearly see that as the gradient of a line increases, the line becomes steeper. Hence, the slope is a measure of the __steepness__ of the line. Practically, what does that mean?

    "We can see that at $x = 0$, both equations have the same output, which is in agreement with the graph above. However, whenever $x$ __changes__ by 1, $y_{A}$ changes by 0.5 and $y_{D}$ changes by 4 due to their different gradients. This $y_{D}$ changes more rapidly with respect to x compared to $y_{A}$. This means that the gradient determines the __rate of change of the output with respect to the input__. Since the gradient(steepness) is constant throughout for a straight line, we can calculate the gradient of a line with the following equation:\n",

    "$$m = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{y_{2} - y_{1}}{x_{2} - x_{1}}$$\n",

    "Even from the definition we can see that the gradient of a line represents how quickly an output $y$ changes with an input $x$. However, the concept of the gradient of an equation cannot directly be applied to other equations or functions that are not linear. Consider for instance, the function below:\n",

The black traces are known as __tangent lines__, which are lines that just barely touch a particular point.

However, it doesn't tell us about any of the individual slopes in between the two points, so it is not the \"best\" approximation, and the more the function differs from a straight line, the worse it will be. Can we make it better? Well, yes. The closer the two points are, the better this approximation becomes, and in fact, when the two points are really, really close, the line of the average slope really starts to look like the tangent line.
