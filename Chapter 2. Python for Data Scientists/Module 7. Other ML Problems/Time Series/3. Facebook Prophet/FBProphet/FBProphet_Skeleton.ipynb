    "**Notebook 1:** Introduction to FB Prophet\n",
    "   1. What is FB Prophet?\n",
    "        - intro to prophet\n",
    "        - use case of prophet (i.e. what makes it powerful compared to other forecasting methods)\n",
    "        - Weaknesses of Prophet (does not perform well for highly skewed data, requires lots of data, sub-daily data)\n",
    "   2. Basic implementation\n",
    "        - discuss uncertainties\n",
    "        - show forecasting ability, and different sketches (as well as what they mean)\n",
    "   2. Model evaluation\n",
    "        - discuss uncertainties (i.e. the confidence interval)\n",
    "        - basic model evlauation (cross validation)\n",
    "   4. Saving and retrieving Prophet model\n",
    "       - implementation using json (recommended by Prophet)\n",
    "   5. Mini Challenge:\n",
    "       - Mini quiz (need to make questions for this)\n",
    "       - Create a forecast on new data (note, this will require the students to do some extra research ON TOP OF wha the lesson teaches)\n",
    "   6. References\n",
    "        \n",
    "**Notebook 2:** Trend flexibility and changepoints\n",
    "   1. What are changepoints?\n",
    "      - definition of changepoints\n",
    "      - example of when you might need to set up your own changepoint\n",
    "   2. Example: setting custom changepoints\n",
    "      - example on data set requiring custom changepoint\n",
    "      - explain that adding custom changepoints is used to avoid overfitting, and that you NEED to know past data\n",
    "   3. What is trend flexibility?\n",
    "      - this affects how 'rigidly' the forecast changes around the changepoints, once again: very important not to overfit or underfit data\n",
    "   4. Example: changing trend flexibility\n",
    "      - example on data set that varies a lot depending on this factor\n",
    "   5. Mini Challenge:\n",
    "      - Mini quiz (need to make questions)\n",
    "      - **This type of mini-challenge will be very niche I think ? Seems to me like FB Prophets automatic changepoint detection is fairly robust. Perhaps the problem should get students to expeirment with the automatic chanepoint parameters**\n",

    "    \n",
    "**Notebook 3:** Dealing with seasonality\n",

    "   3. Example: Linear seasonality\n",
    "       - linear seasonality problem\n",
    "   4. Example: Multiplicative seasonality\n",
    "       - multiplicative seasonality problem\n",
    "   5. How do holidays affect seasonality?\n",
    "       - explain effects of holiday, and how they can sometimes be captured by seasonality, and therefore adding them manually would ruin the model (i.e. christmas will be captured by yearly seasonality anyways)\n",
    "   6. Custom seasonalities\n",
    "       - Explain types of custom seasonalities that you might add\n",
    "   7. Mini Challenge:\n",
    "       - Quiz (quiz should have different dataset descriptions and students should be able to \n",

    "\n",
    "**Notebook 7:** Reinforcement - Model deployment and management\n",
    "   1. How should you save models?\n",
    "       - discuss how typically one might use 'pickle' to save models, however that this does not work very well with prophet models (although i've done this personally, but it is not recommended!)\n",
    "   2. Example of saving model\n",
    "       - show how model can be saved and opened using the python library json, and Prophet's own 'model_to_json' and 'model_from_json'\n",
    "       \n",
    "   3. Updating models\n",
    "       - explain that it's best to re-train entire model\n",
